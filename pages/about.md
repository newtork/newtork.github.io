Hi, I'm Alexander DÃ¼mont and I studied computer science in Berlin, Germany. I've worked in IT support, server administration and software development on several private and corporate projects. Today I try to keep myself busy with web applications, server infrastructure, collaborative software and studying algorithms. I care a lot about optimal algorithmic solutions to problems expressible in a mathematical fashion of any kind.

A couple of months ago I started working with Docker. I found it to be a great opportunity to conveniently experiment with service tool chains and server infrastructure in a private environment. And recently I touched the field of GPGPU programming, in hopes to accelerate number crunching tasks.
