In less than a year, there will be the next [elections for the Bundestag in Germany][election]. Again we will face interesting political outcomes and changing trends on the level of country, state and city, even district. Thanks to the wonders of the World Wide Web, we can acknowledge statistics to almost anything in high definition. In a little web project I did some years ago, I examined political, social and economical data of districts in Germany with regard to spatial properties and the results of the federal election in 2013.

I have used the opportunity to upload my project again to a live environment. Even though it has been years since I touched it, I will be more than happy to upload new data about the same time next year. With a little luck we will see additional trends in how much change has happened in a spatial perception.
