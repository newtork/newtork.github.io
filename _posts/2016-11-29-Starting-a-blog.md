[fish][fishi0x01] encouraged me to start a developer blog. Thanks to him, I shall now be able to write down some thoughts, difficulties I face during developing and their solutions.


### Jekyll ###
The blog is powered by [jekyll][Jekyll] and [github][Github].

```
It's allowing to use traditional markdown syntax to style pages and posts.
```

I found this to be very...
{% include tags/hint-start.html %}
convenient.
{% include tags/hint-end.html %}
