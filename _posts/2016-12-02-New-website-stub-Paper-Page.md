Another little, personal web project yielded the need for a gimmicky site. Especially on mobile devices the "touch" feature can bring additional aspects to the usability. I liked the idea of turning pages, that's why I forked [botelho/flipboard-layout](https://github.com/botelho/flipboard-layout) in 2014. I did some digging, and here it is again: [Paper Page][paper].

First of all, feel free to look into the [demo][demo].

Because the original project had great UI performance and visuals, I chose to start from there. I've updated the JavaScript dependencies, added rotation and bookmarks and did some visual tweaking.

### Features

 - static website for simple, multiple pages
 - JavaScript driven page turning
 - optimized for touch devices and displays of all sizes
 - fall back stylesheet for a window too small
 - custom rotation
 - custom bookmarks

Now that I'm back to working with this template, I'm going to add other features, as you can see in the [GitHub repository][paper].
