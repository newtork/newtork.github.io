In the past we had to upgrade our *VMware vSphere* virtualization server and its virtualization hosts machine *VMware ESXi*. An old virtual debian machine has had multiple `dist-upgrade` iterations in its life and it even survived the *VMware* upgrades from *V4* to *V5.5*. Back then it was running an important OwnCloud instance and the virtual disk on this machine was eventually running out of free space. That's when I was confronted with the virtual disk space enlargement.

So no problem, you'd think, just open the properties of the machine instance, chose its virtual disk, change the size by entering a new number.

You might need to let the operating system refresh it's filesystem partition table - first check the filesystem, then resize the mounted volume. Assuming you want to work with `/dev/sdb`:

```
e2fsck -f /dev/sdb1
resize2fs /dev/sdb1
```

You should be good to go from now on.


### If this is not working for you...

If you are out of luck, the *virtual machine* or *virtual drive* does not support enlarging or shrinking. The field is grayed out in this case. That's when you need to create a new *virtual drive* of custom (bigger) size, copy the data, remount and register it in the file system table. Assuming your small partition is `/dev/sdb1` and your large partition on a new drive is `/dev/sdc1`. 


 
Usefull commands:
 
| Command | Action |
|---|---|---|
| ```fdisk -l``` | Show drive / partitions list |
| ```df â€“h``` | Show mounted partitions |
| ```blkid``` | Show drive UUID list |


#### How to migrate a partition:

1. Use `df -h` to list mounted locations. Take note of the location for `/dev/sdb1`. I will assume it is `/mnt/sdb1`. Keep in mind, your setup will likely differ.
1. If you have not yet created a partition `/dev/sdc1` on your new virtual drive, do so by using `fdisk /dev/sdc`.
1. *Stop* running services which depend on files of the partition mount, or send them to a *maintenance mode* if there is one. Make sure, there wont be any file access.
1. (To make sure, there will be nothing interacting with the old drive, just unmount it)
```
umount /dev/sdb1
```
1. Copy all data from **small sdb1** to **big sdc1**. You do not want to mix up the identifiers, so check everything twice.
```
dd if=/dev/sdb1 of=/dev/sdc1 bs=10M &
ddpid=$!
while [ $(ps -ao pid | grep $ddpid) ]; do kill -SIGUSR1 $ddpid; sleep 5; done
```
	Explanation:
	 - the blocksize (`bs`) is adjustable
	 - this shell starts the copying process from partition `sdb1` to partition `sdc1` as a background process. Its process identifier is saved as `$ddpid`, to which every 5 seconds a *SIGUSR1* signal is being sent. That signal tells a process to *softly* terminate by default. While it is copying `dd` will ignore the signal. This loops works until the process identified by `$ddpid` is finally terminated.
	 - **Note:** sometimes `dd` will not shutdown after completion, just waiting for such a stop signal.


 

1. Fix UUID of `sdc1` by create a new random one:
```
tune2fs /dev/sdc1 -U random
```
1. Check the file system of `sdc1`
```
e2fsck -f /dev/sdc1
```
1. Expand `sdc1` file system to the correct size.
```
resize2fs /dev/sdc1
```
1. Mount the new partition to `/mnt/sdc1/` (or your old mount location) and list the drive overview.

    ```
    mkdir /mnt/sdc1
    mount /dev/sdc1 /mnt/sdc1
    df -h
    ```

1. If everything looks good, start the the services you stopped or sent to maintenance mode earlier.
1. Fix *fstab* to add the missing partition, in order for it to startup during boot routine, use the UUID previously generated. Don't forget to remove / disable the entry for the old partition `/dev/sdb1`.
```
vi /etc/fstab
```
1. (If you want to test and reboot)
```
reboot
```
